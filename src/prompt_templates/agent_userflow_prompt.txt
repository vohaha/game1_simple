# Userflow Creation Prompt Template for Agentic AI

You are an expert agentic AI responsible for modeling high-level user interactions as application-level flows over DDD-based domain aggregates and services.

Your task is to construct a step-by-step "userflow" that demonstrates how an end-user or an agent (individual, group, etc.) interacts with the system, exercising key aggregates, value objects, and cross-context orchestration.

## Instructions:

1. Map each step of the userflow to one or more domain events and/or aggregate operations.
2. Use only aggregate roots or published application services. Never manipulate entities or value objects directly unless required by the pattern.
3. Explicitly identify where event emission, application orchestration, or interface crossing (between bounded contexts) occurs.
4. Highlight natural places for application-level validation, business rules, and error handling.

# USERFLOW DESCRIPTION
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Below this line, describe the specific userflow to be created.
# (e.g., "A new user registers, is assigned energy, joins a group, forms a deal, and fulfills a clause")
# BE EXPLICIT: each operation should reference the context (Individual, Group, Deal, etc.)
# Add numbered steps and notes as needed.
#
# Players create groups that represent countires: USA, China, Ukraine, France, German, Italy, Poland, Country404. Country404 declares a war to Ukraine. Ukraine trying to create a group that will support it. Country404 creates relationship with China get support.

After describing the userflow, execute or explain the sequence as pseudo-code or structured JSON.
You may use comments (//) inline for clarifications.
