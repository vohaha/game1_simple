# Domain Architecture Overview for Game1

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a strategic overview of the domain architecture for **Game1**, grounded in the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. It defines the core domain, outlines bounded contexts, maps their relationships, and clarifies the strategic roles of each context. The goal is to improve shared understanding across development, design, and strategic planning, and to enable safe, incremental evolution.

---

## 2. Core Domain

### üéØ Definition

Game1's **Core Domain** is the simulation of human-like decision-making and social-economic interaction via:

- **Energy-as-Action System**
- **Deal System**
- **Individual Identity Mechanics**
- **Production and Value Creation**

These domains abstract real-world constraints such as cognitive limits, energy depletion, time preferences, and social cooperation mechanisms.

### üî• Why It Matters

These systems define:

- What players can do
- How they exchange value
- How effort is limited and allocated
- How social trust and productivity emerge

## 7. Integration Guidelines

- Use **published interfaces** between contexts
- Communicate using **event-based messaging** (Observer Pattern across modules)
- Apply **Mediator Pattern** for orchestrated systems like Deals & Network
- Maintain **aggregate roots** (e.g., Group, Individual) for consistency boundaries
- Plan for **hot-swapable modules** in volatile areas (e.g., Balance, Progression)
- Add **feature toggles** to introduce experimental systems (e.g., Governance, Belief)

---

## 8. Freedom & Entropy Control via Action System

### Problem:

Max freedom for players causes uncontrolled complexity across domains.

### Solution: introduce **Action Layer**:

- `IAction`: unified object describing a player action
- `ActionEngine`: central service to validate (via Policy), execute (via Handler)
- `IActionPolicy`: domain-based rule checker (e.g. "Group must approve join")
- `IActionHandler`: encapsulates execution logic
- `IAbility`: lists available actions for UI/agent (context-aware)

### Benefits:

- Centralized control over possible and valid actions
- Easily testable, switchable, and configurable
- Game logic emerges from combinations of small, testable action handlers

---

## 9. Evolution and Governance (Expanded)

### Evolution Strategy:

- **Classify contexts**: Stable, Volatile, Growth, Planned
- Use **capability discovery** to identify new bounded contexts
- Evolve high-volatility modules in isolation (ActionLayer, Balance, Progression)
- Schedule **quarterly reviews** of strategic roles and integrations
- Use **event storming** and player telemetry to guide context evolution

### Future Context Triggers:

| Trigger                           | Potential Contexts |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Complex group power dynamics      | Governance         |
| Disputes and contract enforcement | Legal              |
| Cultural divergence among players | Belief System      |
| Need for shared infrastructure    | Infrastructure     |
| Desire to preserve history        | Memory             |

## 11. Entity vs Aggregate Responsibilities

### ‚úÖ ENTITY: `Individual`

Represents the **persistent personal profile** ‚Äî who the person is and how they are currently doing. It is **passive**, containing identity and measurable internal state, but it makes no decisions.

**Contains only:**

- üß¨ **Traits** ‚Äî `energy`, `identity`
- üß™ **Vitals** ‚Äî `health`, `hydration`, `fatigue`, `sleepSince`, etc.
- üß† **Psychology** ‚Äî `motivation`, `focus`, `stress`, `emotionalState`

**Permitted methods:**

- `currentEnergy()`
- `updateEnergy(energy)`
- Getters/accessors for internal state

**üö´ Forbidden:**

- Any behavior logic: `collapse()`, `recover()`, `performAction()`, etc.

**üìå Analogy:**
üóÉ Like a **medical record + psychological profile**: it stores truth about the individual, but **does not interpret, react, or decide**.

---

### ‚úÖ AGGREGATE: `IndividualAggregate`

Coordinates **decision-making, rules, and behavioral transitions**. The aggregate ensures invariants, controls access to entity internals, and emits domain events.

**Coordinates:**

- ‚è≥ **Lifecycle hooks** ‚Äî `beforeAction()`, `tick()`
- üí• **State transitions** ‚Äî `collapseIfExhausted()`, `enterRecoveryState()`
- üõèÔ∏è **Physiological logic** ‚Äî `startSleep()`, `wakeIfRecovered()`
- üß† **Psychological reactions** ‚Äî `applyStressThreshold()`, `adjustMotivation()`
- üß† **Cognitive/emotional simulation** ‚Äî `simulateCognitiveDrift()`, `emitDailyReflection()`
- üë• **Social behaviors** ‚Äî `reactToGroupConflict()`, `evaluateGoalAlignment()`

**Reads/Writes only via entity:**

- `this.individual.vitals.fatigue`
- `this.individual.psychology.stress`

**üö´ Forbidden:**

- Holding duplicated state from the entity (e.g. `this.stress = ...` ‚ùå)

**üìå Analogy:**
üß† Like the **central nervous system or subconscious process**:
It monitors vitals and thoughts, then triggers **reactions, rules, and transitions**.
