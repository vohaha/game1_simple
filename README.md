# Game1: Emergent Simulation of Human Systems

## Concept

**Game1** is a simulation game designed to model the fundamental forces that shape human behavior, productivity, and collaboration. Players inhabit a world where every mechanic reflects real psychological and physical constraints, allowing them to form groups, create value, negotiate agreements, and evolve social and economic structures — all through natural interactions rather than artificial rules.

At its core, Game1 explores the **real reasons** why humans do what they do: conserve energy, seek meaning, form alliances, manage time, and balance trade-offs. Players are not forced down pre-defined paths, but instead interact with emergent systems where **everything not prohibited is allowed**.

## Philosophy

The game is based on a few timeless principles:

- **Psychological Realism**: Every mechanic stems from how real people think, behave, and organize.
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules lead to rich, unpredictable behaviors over time.
- **Individual Agency**: Systems are built to amplify meaningful choices, not limit them.
- **Abstraction of Reality**: Features reflect the _why_, not the _what_, behind real-world systems.
- **Natural Regulation**: Balancing and feedback loops are emergent and grounded in systemic friction, not imposed limitations.

## Gameplay Themes

Game1 is not about winning — it’s about _becoming_. The systems simulate:

- **Energy & Effort**: Individuals manage actions and rest in a world where energy is finite.
- **Group Dynamics**: Individuals form groups to specialize, scale, and survive.
- **Deal-Making**: Cooperation emerges through agreements with real trust dynamics.
- **Production & Service**: Value is created through attention, focus, and skill.
- **Temporal Rhythms**: Time matters. Rest, work, and biological preferences shape productivity.
- **Progression Without Levels**: Growth is visible through reputation, output, and mastery, not numbers.
- **Buffs & Debuffs as Real Conditions**: Effects represent psychological or social realities like burnout or focus.

## Technical & Structural Foundation

Technical & Structural Foundation

Game1 is developed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure that every part of the system reflects real-world human behavior, constraints, and mental models. The code is structured to clearly separate what the system is from how it behaves, allowing complexity to emerge naturally from clear boundaries.

🧠 Strategic Design
• Bounded Contexts define distinct domains of the simulation (e.g., Energy, Group, Production, Deal).
• Ubiquitous Language is used across code and documentation — concepts like Action Tokens, Service Agreements, and Group Roles mean the same thing everywhere.
• Each context maps directly to real-world analogies and is modeled from the inside out, not by data structures but by behaviors and rules.

🧩 Tactical Building Blocks
• Entities: Individual, Groups, and Products have persistent identity and history.
• Value Objects: Concepts like Efficiency, Quality, and Action Capacity are immutable and behavior-rich — they encapsulate meaning, not just data.
• Aggregates: Core integrity rules are enforced at the aggregate root — e.g., a Group governs access to its Memberships, not the other way around.
• Domain Services: Behavior that doesn’t belong to a specific entity but expresses key domain logic lives here — such as validation of complex agreements or group coordination logic.
• Repositories: Abstract away persistence while preserving intention — “find group by ID” vs “query a database”.

🛠️ Infrastructure as a Secondary Concern
• Infrastructure (e.g. databases, APIs, schedulers) is layered around the domain model.
• Game logic is not dependent on any specific tech stack — it’s testable, portable, and modular.
• The architecture ensures that changing the implementation never changes the business rules.

📡 Event-Driven Core
• Domain Events drive communication between contexts (e.g., “ActionTokenTransferred”, “DealBreached”).
• Events propagate behavior while maintaining decoupled boundaries — simulating how real-world systems respond to change.

🛡️ Principles in Practice
No strict rules but rely on well known best practices like SOLID, GOF, aware about security using OWASP, CWE.

## Long-Term Vision

Game1 is more than a game — it’s a **tool for insight**. It could one day help:

- Simulate social experiments
- Model organizational efficiency
- Explore economic policies
- Study real human behavior in virtual spaces

## Who is this for?

Game1 is for thinkers, builders, strategists, and philosophers. If you're curious about how and why humans build society the way they do — and want to shape your own world from scratch — Game1 is your sandbox.

> **Note**: This game is a simulation, not a fantasy. It doesn’t promise fun — it promises **truths** about systems, and the chance to explore them.
